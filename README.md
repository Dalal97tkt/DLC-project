Side channel attacks on prime generation methods
The full report on the attack is in `Rapport.pdf`.
# Attack1: Simple power analysis on basic sieve.
The basic sieve is in `crible.c`, the attack is in `attaque1.c`, and the code used for running the attack multiple times to reproduce the results is
in `results.c`.
# Attack2 : Horizontal correlation power analysis on optimized sieve.
The optimized sieve is in `prime_generation.c`, the attack is in `attaque2.c` ,and a simple test is included in `test.c`. 

https://github.com/lydiab23 is a huge contributor to the project, and the initial repo that was used is https://github.com/lydiab23/DLC, i just moved it here with more notes to be able to navigate it quicker. Nada Bondi, and Lise Matet also helped work on the project and provided helpful input.
